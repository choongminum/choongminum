### Summary
I am a Ph.D. student in physics and an ISTQB-certified software engineer. My research interests include computational plasma physics. I strive for a strong body, a sharp mind, and a compassionate heart.

### Positions
Graduate Assistant, 08/2021 - Present<br>
Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH<br>
- Assisted in developing the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISIS) on the Solar Probe Plus (SPP) mission<br>
- Assisted in developing the Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Module (EPREM)<br>
- Assisted in teaching PHYS 402: Introduction to Physics II<br>
- Assisted in teaching PHYS 401: Introduction to Physics I<br>

Intern, 09/2016 – 02/2019<br>
Center for Theoretical Physics of the Universe, Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon, Republic of Korea<br>
- Conducted research into physical phenomena, especially cosmology and astroparticle physics. Specialized in describing gravitational waves (GWs) from the early universe.<br>
- Performed field theoretic lattice simulations of axionic cosmic strings and domain walls via Fortran. Studied their motion and decay for GW spectrum and peak frequency.<br>
- Helped discover a new theory of propagating shockwaves developed during extremely strong first-order phase transitions in the early universe that could have been used as a source of GWs<br>
- Published a peer-reviewed paper<br>

QA Engineer I, II, 12/2012 – 06/2014<br>
Samsung Telecommunications America, Bellevue, WA<br>
- Tested software on mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S and Note series<br>
- Performed manual and automated test cases and reported software bugs. Fixed the bugs and optimized energy consumption and RF performance in conjunction with the R&D department.<br>
- Developed test plans and standards to ensure product quality and release readiness. Worked with project managers to launch or update the new firmware on time.<br>
- Wrote a paper on mobile phones, RF radiation, and associated health risks to be distributed within the QA department<br>
